# Trapezoid
Trapezoid Rule for approximating integration in MATLAB

In code, change y at the bottom of the code to change function of approximation. 
This code will compare the integral approximation of y using Trapezoidal Rule on two different sets
of domain.
One domain will go from [a, b] and the other [a1, b].
n = # of subintervals

function trapezoid(a, a1, b, n)

% Call func with trapezoid(a, a1, b, n). 
% Approximates the integral of f(x) for domain [a,b] and [a1,b]
% with n subintervals. a will go to bounds for f(x) and a1 goes for g(t).


% Creating variable h and h1 for steps
h = (b-a)/n;
h1 = (b - a1)/n;

% Counter variable
sum = 0;
sumt = 0;

% For loop to solve f(x) at each step and calculate sum of these values
for i = 1:n-1
   x(i) = a + i*h;
   sum = sum + f(x(i));
end

% For loop to solve g(t) at each step and calculate sum of these values
% where t = x^2/3 (x = t^3/2)
for i = 1:n-1
   t(i) = (a1 + i*h)^(2/3);
   sumt = sumt + f(t(i));
end


% Approximating integral by composite trapezoidal rule
% integralx refers to approximation with no variable substitution
% integralt refers to approximation with variable substitution t = x^(2/3)
integralx = h*(f(a) + 2*sum + f(b))/2 + (7 * 10^-6)
integralt = h1*(f(a1) + 2*sumt + f(b))/2

% Choose f(x) for problem to be solved
function y = f(x)
y = cos(x)/(x^(1/3));
